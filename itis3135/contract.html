        <h2>Course Contract</h2> 

        <section>
            <p><em>I, Kellen Ballou, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, ITIS 3135, Introduction to Web Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class, it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Signed:</strong> Kellen Ballou, 09/15/2024</p>
