        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla</a></h3>
            <p>The official website for Tesla, showcasing its electric vehicles, solar products, and company information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Tesla's website applies bold colors and lots of white space to highlight the most important elements, making the design visually attractive.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts, colors, and button styles creates a cohesive user experience throughout the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is well-aligned, with grids and spacing that guide the userâ€™s eye naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements, such as product details and CTAs, are grouped together effectively, making it more usable.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest X-Ray</a></h3>
            <p>An online store for x-ray equipment and supplies with an outdated and poorly designed interface.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Insufficient color contrast makes reading on this site difficult, and too little distinct difference between key elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Scattered usage of font sizes, colors, and design elements disrupt the general cohesion of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Irregularly aligned text and images make the site disorganized and frustrating to explore.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements are scattered with groupings of unrelated items causing confusing layout.</li>
            </ul>
